\subsection*{Introduction}
My name is Jacob Maronge. I am a 2nd year PhD Student in the Department of Statistics and Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics working with Professor Paul J. Rathouz. Generally, my research interests lie in the areas of experimental design and longitudinal or clustered data, including under situations with biased sampling schemes, such as outcome dependent sampling. Current areas of application include communication sciences and language and speech development. Below I highlight a couple of the projects I am working on here at UW, one of an applied nature and one that is more methodological. If you have any questions about our program after your visit, please reach out to me at jmmaronge@gmail.com.

\subsection*{Analysis of Speech Trajectories in Children with Cerebral Palsy}

Paul and I collaborate with Professor Katie Hustad and her lab here at UW. A main project in Katie's lab involves following a longitudinal cohort of young children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) into adulthood while monitoring speech development compared to normally developing children. In some children, CP also affects their speech capabilities. We would like to be able to use the 38 children in this cohort to reach the following goals:
